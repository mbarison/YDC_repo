Rehearsals and Concerts

<P align="justify" STYLE="font-size: 12px;">
We rehearse every Wednesday evening from 7:20 pm to 10:00 pm at The Unitarian Church of Montreal, 5035 Boulevard de Maisonneuve Ouest in N.D.G. Rehearsals run from September through June. Additional rehearsals are held on the two Monday evenings preceding a major concert, and one or two sectional rehearsals are held per session, usually at the Director's home.

We typically give 2 Major concerts per year: one the last Friday and Saturday in January and the other the last Friday and Saturday in May. We also give a few free concerts during the year, such as at seniors’ residences and other fund-raisers.
