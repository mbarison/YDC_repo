The mission of the Yellow Door Choir is to share the gift of song and to use the power of music to support our community. The choir has been using song to nurture and support charitable organizations in the Montreal community since 1983. We do this by building partnerships with local charities, using our performances to raise funds for them and to profile their vital work.
