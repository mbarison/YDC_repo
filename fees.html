The membership fee is $250 per year (two sessions) payable in two installments, the first of which is due by October 1st and the second by January 15th. This fee covers the music director’s salary, the rental of rehearsal space, and acquisition of the musical scores. Members who are not able to pay this fee may speak privately to the choir treasurer to make other arrangements.
