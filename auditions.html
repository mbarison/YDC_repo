We welcome men and women who can sing, and who share a love of music and a commitment to community. Ability to read music is an asset but not a requirement.

Auditions are held regularly in the two weeks preceding the start of each new session (typically, this audition period is in early February and early September). <!--<B>Auditions will be held on August 25, 26 and September 2, 2009</B>. --> The availability of specific positions in the various sections (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) is determined by departures of existing members as well as the desire of the director to create new positions in order to better balance the overall sound. <!-- Although tenors are especially needed, we have some spots open for basses, sopranos and altos as well. -->

Previous choral experience as well as some degree of music-reading ability is a great asset, but it is not an absolute pre-requisite. If you lack these qualities but have a strong musical sense, a pleasant voice, and a love for a wide variety of musical styles, you would still have an excellent chance of passing the audition process.

Auditions are held at at a choir member's home in NDG and take about 15 minutes, during which you sing some scales and intervals to establish your vocal range, followed by a brief song or excerpt of some piece that you feel showcases your talents. We charge a non-refundable $10 fee for the audition process.

We believe that The Yellow Door Choir is Montreal's most eclectic vocal ensemble, singing widely divergent musical styles from classical to pop to world beat to jazz. Another unique element of this choir is that you'll have the opportunity, if you wish, to shine in one of the smaller, self-directed ensembles that have become a fixture of our concerts. For budding soloists, this degree of musical opportunity is not usually available in other choirs.
