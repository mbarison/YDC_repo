One of the most distinctive aspects of the Yellow Door Choir is its philosophy of sharing the proceeds of its concerts with charitable organizations. In addition, the choir has staged benefit concerts and free concerts, has given away tickets, and—to the delight of concert-goers and choristers alike—has arranged for bake sales during regular concert intermissions. Altogether, over 55 charities have benefited from the choir’s efforts. These include:
