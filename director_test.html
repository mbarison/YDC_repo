<p>As a singer and conductor, Roxanne Martel has always been drawn to the richness and variety of the choral repertoire and to its huge range of expression through the power of combined voices. Roxanne has sung with the Ensemble Musica Orbium since 2002, and has enjoyed performing with other ensembles including the Montreal Elgar Choir, the Stewart Hall Singers and the Aurora Chorealis choir. Roxanne has sung several large-scale choral works, such as the Berlioz Requiem and the Verdi Requiem, with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<p>Roxanne's conducting experience has included the Beckett Players musical productions, the Labrador City Community Choir, the Mount Royal Ladies' Chorale and several church choirs. Roxanne has been the music teacher and choral director at The Sacred Heart School of Montreal since 1988.</p>

<p>Roxanne graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Music degree, with Honours in School Music. She received a graduate Diploma in Fine Arts, specializing in the Kod&aacute;ly method, from the University of Calgary. In 2004 she took a year-long sabbatical, with an International Kod&aacute;ly Society Scholarship, for study at the International Kod&aacute;ly Institute in Kecskem&eacute;t, Hungary.</p>
