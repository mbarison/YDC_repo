History of the Choir
</P>
<P align="justify" STYLE="font-size: 12px;">
The Yellow Door Choir (originally called the Yellow Door Tabernacle Choir) was founded in 1983 by a group of some fifteen music lovers looking to pursue their musical interests in a more disciplined manner than that afforded by sporadic sing-alongs around kitchen tables. From its basement beginnings at the Yellow Door (Canada’s longest-running coffee house) and under Linda Morrison’s inspired direction, the choir’s membership quickly doubled and its concerts attracted an ever-expanding and dedicated audience.

From the beginning, the YDC has been unique among choirs for two elements: its eclecticism, each performance being a cornucopia of musical styles, cultures, and languages; and its ethic of sharing not only its music but the profits of its performances with the larger community. The earlier repertoire included traditional folk music and spirituals, retrieved from dusty archives and obscure recordings by Linda, or learned orally in her musical travels and subsequently arranged for the choir.

Linda left the choir in 1997. During the next year and a half, three guest conductors—Paul Keenan, Ari Snyder, and Mary-Jane Puiu—contributed their considerable talents to the choir. Eleanor Stubley became musical director in 1998, and the choir continued to evolve while remaining dedicated to the performance of world music in many languages. Songs have been commissioned especially for the choir, and many of its international folk selections have been arranged by well-known composers in their countries of origin. The choir’s cumulative repertoire now spans 12 centuries and at least 19 languages.

Small ensembles of choir members add a charming contrast to the full choir at concerts. The participation of the Chad Linsley Jazz Trio, Sweatshop Tango Ensemble, and others in our concerts have introduced variety and novelty. Pianist-accompanists Erica Smith, Lynette Wahlstrom, Amy Zanrosso, and Geneviève Jalbert have been tremendously valuable assets.

In the early years, rehearsals were held in members’ homes, a tradition still observed on occasion. By the late 1980s, the Unitarian Church of Montreal’s Channing Hall had become the choir’s unofficial home.

After a 10-year interval following the destruction of the church by fire in 1987, the choir re-established the connection and found a permanent home and a partnership with the Church, which generously assists with both rehearsal and performance spaces in its current building. The choir has also performed at Café commun-commune, the Salvation Army’s Citadel, Saidye Bronfman Centre, Maimonides Geriatric Centre (annually since 2003), Mackay Rehabilitation Centre, CBC radio, CTV, and senior citizens’ and nursing homes.
