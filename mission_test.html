<h3>Who we are, what we do</h3>

<P>The YDC is unique among choirs. First &mdash; for the eclectic variety of music we sing (our repertoire now spans 12 centuries and at least 19 languages) and for our mission of sharing not only music but the profits of our performances with charitable organizations in the community. In addition, the choir has staged benefit concerts and free concerts, has given away tickets, and &mdash; to the delight of concert-goers and choristers alike &mdash; has arranged for bake sales during regular concert intermissions. Altogether, over 60 charities have benefited from the choir's efforts so far, including Head and Hands, The Montreal Children's Hospital, Mackay Rehabilitation Center, and Dans la Rue.</P>

<P>Ensemble performances are another of the distinguishing features of the YDC, and everyone in the choir &mdash; especially new members &mdash; is encouraged to participate. An ensemble is a small group of choir members that comes together to sing and perform a piece of music that they have chosen themselves. The music director offers coaching as required, and the final piece is featured in that season's concert program.</P>
