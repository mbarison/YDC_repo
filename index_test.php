    <h3>Welcome to the Yellow Door Choir!</h3>

    <p><b>A community choir that welcomes singers from all walks of life, we partner with local charities and use our concerts to support their good work. We sing an eclectic variety of music, including classical, traditional, gospel, jazz, pop, and folk from all over the world.  We want to celebrate life through music - and we're open to all!</b></p>

    <p>The yellow door choir has been singing for more than three decades, and over the years, our performances have featured guest soloists, musicians, comedians and dancers. The choir is under the direction of <A HREF="http://yellowdoorchoir.com/choir.php?s=director">Roxanne Martel</a>, who conducts almost 30 singers of a wide range of ages, nationalities, and musical backgrounds.</p>

    <p>Here, you can find out more about our upcoming concerts, how and when to audition, and more about our history. Please get in touch if you would like the choir to come and sing at your location, if you would like to join as a charity partner, or if you would like to make a donation to help us keep up the good work.</p>
