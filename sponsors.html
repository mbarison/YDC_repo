<B>Message from the Unitarian Church</b>
</p>
<P align="justify" STYLE="font-size: 12px;">
The Yellow Door Choir has had a long association with the Unitarian Church of Montreal, rehearsing in the hall for the past ten years or more, holding many concerts in the sanctuary, and, from time to time, gracing our Sunday services with song. The ideals of music, culture, and support of worthy community groups have been shared by the Unitarian Church and The Yellow Door Choir during all those years. We are pleased to support their mission of building community through their performances and fostering an understanding of the rich cultural heritage of Montreal with their varied repertoire.
